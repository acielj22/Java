Challenge 1:
Create a class Car using the UML provided in the UML Car.PNG file. (Remember to create a separate file that must have the exact same name as the class name, i.e., Car.java). Make the class have a function honk() that says "Beep Beep!"
public class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private String color;
    private int year;
    private double value;

Challenge 2:
Create two car objects and store them in separate variables.
public Car(String brand, String model, String color, int year, double value) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
        this.value = value;
Challenge 3:
Display to the console the brand, model and value of each car.
Make the ist car honk.

Bonus:
Display the brand and model of any car that has a value over 30,000. (You need to get that information from the object itself to determine the value.)
